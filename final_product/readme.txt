  Additionally, if you wish to edit the generated Microsoft Excel file, you may find that some parts (particularly the charts) cannot be changed.  To make all parts of the file editable, create a new sheet (by pressing the '+' at the bottom of the Excel file).  Once this is done, all parts of the file should be editable.
